# `World Economic Indicator`
This project aims to explore the factors that contribute to sustainable growth in countries and regions using the World Economic Indicator Dataset. By analyzing various economic indicators and employing data analysis methods, I strive to provide insights on how a country can achieve sustainable growth.

## `Problem Statement`
The problem is: **"How can a country attain sustainable growth?"** Sustainable growth refers to the ability of a country or region to maintain a steady and balanced economic expansion over an extended period. Achieving sustainable growth is crucial for long-term economic stability and the overall well-being of a country.

## `Dataset`
I will be utilizing the **World Economic Indicator Dataset**, which provides information on GDP (Gross Domestic Product), population, and other relevant factors that can impact the GDP of a country. 

## `Solution Approach`
To tackle the problem statement, I will employ data analysis methods to identify the key factors that contribute to sustainable growth. My solution approach consists of the following steps:

**1. Applied Formatting and Data Processing**

Merged the datasets, handled missing values and outliers, and created new features like GDP/Capita, CO2 Emission/Capita, Energy Consumption/Capita, Tourism Outbound/Capita, etc, to ensure the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis.

**2. Performed Analysis to gain Insights**

Performed Bivariate Analysis between GDP/Capita & other features. Also, Univariate Analysis with statistical values & histogram graph.

**3. Evaluated the Insights and created a Storyline**

Created a final presentation using all the insights containing the **Executive Summary** and all the statistical graphs in **Annexure**.
